### A Hybrid Vernacular AI-Powered Fleet Management & Vital-Aware Cargo Optimization System

---

## 📌 Overview

**ROUTIQ** is a **software-defined, low-cost fleet management and logistics optimization platform** designed to modernize the **unorganized logistics sector** in developing economies. The system overcomes the limitations of traditional Fleet Management Systems (FMS) by eliminating expensive proprietary hardware and breaking the language barrier faced by non-English-speaking drivers.

By combining **low-cost OBD-II telematics**, **smartphone sensors**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and a **vernacular voice assistant**, ROUTIQ delivers an inclusive, intelligent, and safety-aware logistics ecosystem.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Existing fleet management solutions suffer from:

* ❌ High deployment and maintenance costs
* ❌ Dependence on proprietary hardware
* ❌ English-only dashboards and alerts
* ❌ Cargo allocation based only on location, ignoring vehicle health

These limitations exclude small fleet owners and regional drivers from adopting smart logistics technologies.
